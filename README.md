# TallyUp

TallyUp is a web application that allows users to create an event, add any number of participants, and then keep track of wins, losses, and ties between participants. Students often want to play a series of games with their friends (i.e. FIFA) where itâ€™s hard to keep track of wins and losses over a long period of time. TallyUp will allow college students to engage in long term game play with friends and to record their game results, in order to keep track of win/loss statistics.

## About Me
* **Ben Debebe** - I am Computer Science major minoring in Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating class of 2017. I have been programming for 2 years now and my experience in writing web applications, integrated with SQL-based databases and HTML/CSS/Javascript on the front-end helped in making this website. Ben loves playing soccer and FIFA with his friends.

## Technologies
* **Flask** - Flask (http://flask.pcooo.org) is a micro framework for Python that provides a built-in development server and debugger, integrated unit testing support, RESTful request dispatching, and support for secure cookies. It is lightweight and well-documented, making it a great option.
* **PostgreSQL** - PostgreSQL (http://postgresql.org) is an open source object-relational database management system with an emphasis  on extensibility and standards-compliance. PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is cross-platform, and easily integrates easily with Flask, thus very valuable in terms of storing data securely and being able to retrieve it later.
* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) is a framework which uses HTML, CSS, and JS to build interactive and sensible user interfaces.
* **jQuery** - jQuery (http://jquery.com) is a JavaScript library that provides easy HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation and Ajax calls. Its API is extremely accessible and extensive, making it an obvious choice.

## Instructions
* **Setup** - Install Python and pip. Then, run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
